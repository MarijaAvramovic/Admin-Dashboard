# Admin-Dashboard

Practice Layout
The project has HTML elements  sidebar, header and main-content containers.
Layout made with only Grid properties.
Also I added child elements under the parent elements in the HTML and styled them with grid as well. Focused to keep making grid containers within grid containers.


In the sidebar, I used more grids to lay out the navigation and branding sections.
In the header, I used more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons.
For the main-content, I used more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items.

 
Created a dashboard example from Odin Project. I used font awesome icons.

I used my own fonts, font face!  
 
 
This project is not responsive, but I added autofill to expand or shrink the project cards section when resizing the browser window.

 
 
 Time spent: 4x2h.
