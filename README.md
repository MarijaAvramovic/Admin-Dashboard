# Admin-Dashboard

Practice Layout
The project has HTML elements  sidebar, header and main-content containers.
Layout made with only Grid properties.
Also I added child elements under the parent elements in the HTML and styled them with grid as well. Focused to keep making grid containers within grid containers.


In the sidebar, I used more grids to lay out the navigation and branding sections.
In the header, I used more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons.
For the main-content, I used more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items.

 
Created a dashboard example from Odin Project. USed font awesome icons.

Choose your own fonts! The design example uses Roboto, which is available with Google fonts. (You may want to review the More Text Styles Lesson for information about how to include external fonts in your projects).
 
 
This project is not responsive, but I added autofill to expand or shrink the project cards section when resizing the browser window.
